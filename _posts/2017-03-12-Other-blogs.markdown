## Introduction

This is just an on-going list of other blogs / personal websites I've found useful, interesting, well-written, or all of the above.

Feel free to leave a comment and add a blog!


<br/>

### Neural Nets


#### [Andrej Kaparthy][kaparthy]

Some good posts on recurrent neural nets in particular.

> I am Andrej Karpathy, a PhD student at Stanford working on Deep Learning. My [academic website][kaparthy-academic] has much more information.


#### [Chris Olah][colah]

Chris Olah's well-known blog has excellent visualizations and clean explanations of neural net architectures.

> A wandering machine learning researcher, bouncing between groups. I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well.

#### [Adit Deshpande][adit]

Good use of visuals and intuition to explain concepts in deep learning.

> I’m a second year undergraduate student currently studying at UCLA. I’m majoring in computer science while also pursuing a minor in Bioinformatics. I’ve had two research internships in my career, one at Boston University and one at the U.S Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C.
> 
> I’m passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning to areas in healthcare where we can really engineer better solutions for helping doctors and taking care of patients.

### Speech Technology

#### [Simon King][king]

Good, in-depth information on speech synthesis.

> Hi – my name is Simon King and this is my personal website for supporting my teaching. I am the Professor of Speech Processing at the University of Edinburgh, where I teach courses in speech processing and speech synthesis at advanced undergraduate and Masters level.

#### [Eleanor Chodroff][chodroff]

A nice walk through of getting started with Kaldi.

> I am a fifth year graduate student in the Cognitive Science department at Johns Hopkins University.
> 
> My research focuses on the ability of the mind/brain to utilize fine-grained acoustic information in the representation of phonetic and phonological categories. This draws from the fields of phonetics, speech perception, automatic speech recognition, and phonology.

### General

#### [The Synthetic Language Learner][sll]

Some nice posts on (deep) automatic speech recognition... good visualizations!

> This blog is about modeling cognitive development and cognitive functions, especially early language acquisition. We write about technical, theoretical, methodological or empirical issues regarding the use of machine learning and/or big data in cognitive modeling.
> 
> Regular bloggers include members of the [Bootphon Project][bootphon], and we welcome guest posts from other scientists in the vast cognitive science/AI community.


#### [Tim Dettmers][dettmers]

I've found his posts on hardware for deep-learning particularly useful.

> I am an informatics master student at the University of Lugano, Switzerland where in the coming months I will focus on natural language understanding and more specifically, I will work on deep learning for automatic knowledge base construction from raw text data. Before that I build my own GPU cluster and developed algorithms to speed up deep learning on GPU clusters. During my internship at Microsoft Research I worked on algorithms which make deep learning more memory efficient so that larger networks fit into GPU memory.
