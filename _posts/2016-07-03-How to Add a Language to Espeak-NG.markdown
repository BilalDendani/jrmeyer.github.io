## Introduction

Espeak-NG (aka Espeak New Generation) is an open source speech synthesizer which can be found in various projects (e.g. NVDA). Espeak-NG can be also be used as a stand-alone text-to-speech converter to read text out load on a computer.

To add a new language to Espeak-NG, you mostly need to know about the language you're interested. Knowledge of programming, while helpful, is not needed. What you need to know is the sounds of the language, and how they relate to the spelling of the language.

There is indeed good documentation out there already on how to add a new language to Espeak-NG, but in my experience of adding the Kyrgyz langauge I've thought that a clearer, more simple explanation directed towards a non-programmer audience would be useful.

In these illustrations the matrices have row and column headers, but the actual matrices we feed into TensorFlow have none.

The **import_data()** function first checks if the data directory "data/" exists in your current working directory or not. If it doesn't exist, the code tries to unzip the tarred data from the file "data.tar.gz", which is expected to be in your current working directory. 

>You need to have either the "data/" directory or the tarred file "data.tar.gz" in your working directory for the script to work.
