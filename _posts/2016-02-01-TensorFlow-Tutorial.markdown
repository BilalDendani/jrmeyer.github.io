## Introduction

This tutorial is meant for those who want to get to know the *Flow* of TensorFlow. Ideally, you already know some of the *Tensor* of TensorFlow, that is, some understanding of linear algebra and machine learning. Don't worry though, if you don't have that background you will still be able to follow this tutorial. If you're interested in learning more about the math, there's a ton of good places to get an introduction to the algorithms used in machine learning. For artificial neural nets [this one from Stanford][ufldl] is especially good.

Things we will cover in this tutorial:

1. thing 1
2. thing 2 
3. thing 3
