I recently installed Ubunutu 14.04 on my Lenovo Yoga, and it's time to reinstall SPHINX. 

When I installed SPHINX for the first time, it was not a fun experience. I originally followed the instructions on [CMU's website][cmu-sphinx], but I couldn't seem to get it right. The instructions really want you to install and use eclipse, and I don't like IDE's in general. So at first I tried to install SPHINX without eclipse, but got nowhere.
