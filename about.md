I'm a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Arizona. My research is mainly on automatic speech recognition, but I do some natural language processing and I'm interested in general machine learning as well. This blog is some of what I'm learning along the way.

In case you're interested, you can find my [academic CV here]({{ site.url }}/misc/josh-meyer-cv.pdf).

If you have comments or spot some issues in a post, I would very much appreciate your thoughts!
